- [x] add a readme
- [x] show tags beside issue titles
- [ ] have a button to commit all of the current issues in the list for a sprint ("check all" button?)
- [ ] somehow display when an issue was previously part of another sprint
  - should have a page for each issue. It can have:
    - a graph of the points for the issue over time
    - a link to each sprint that the issue appeared in, with the number of points it had during that sprint (which could be a range), and the  state(s) it was in during that sprint
  - display the number of sprints each issue was a part of
- [ ] ability to view a consolidation of sprints (i.e. just take all the data for two or more sprints, and present it as if it were one)
- [ ] a project view. Allow selection of a label, and display all of the issues associated with that label, with stats
 - user has to choose the labels they want to monitor. issues don't get included in the snapshot until they're monitored
 - separate snapshots are created for these projects (but the snapshot can (potentially) reference the same issue snapshots (??))
 - page displays:
   - completion percentage (progress) over time (same as for sprint)
     - On same graph, display total points
   - The current counts of completed points, remaining points and total points
- [ ] try to figure out who worked on issues and provide counts
 - could look at comments to figure out who gave +1, and at commit history to just include anyone who committed

- [ ] on homepage, display both committed completion and total completion
 - maybe with little bar graphs?
- [ ] start date for a sprint (maybe derive by default, but allow it to be editable)
- [ ] spark line in homepage list
- [ ] configurable granularity on sprint page (i.e. only one snapshot per day or per hour or whatever)
- [ ] auto-move issues into the next sprint on Friday afternoons
- [ ] have somewhere to enter how long the meetings are, and show that in a graph (TOP PRIORITY)
- [ ] make it look pretty
- [ ] consider turning the whole thing into the usual frontend app/backend api thing, with an actual frontend framework, blah blah blah
- [ ] Use LESS/Coffeescript/etc..
- [ ] once project stuff is implemented, have super awesome calendar view that just figures out when everything will be done based on velocity, position of issues in queue, etc..
