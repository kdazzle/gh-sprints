- have a button to commit all of the current issues in the list for a sprint
- somehow display when an issue was previously part of another sprint
- on homepage, display both committed completion and total completion
 - maybe with little bar graphs?
- start date for a sprint (maybe derive by default, but allow it to be editable)
- spark line in homepage list
- configurable granularity on sprint page (i.e. only one snapshot per day or per hour or whatever)
- add a readme
